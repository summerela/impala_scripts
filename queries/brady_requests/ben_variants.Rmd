# Purpose: 
Ben has been studying a child with a trifunctional protein deficiency and would like to know if there are any 
other variants near the HADHB allele. 

- Search all variants found in family trio  
- For genes of interest in the region  
- Homozygous or compound heterozygous in the newborn  
- Check for Mammalian Inheritance Errors (MIE)  
- Add Kaviar allele frequency to distinguish rare variants  

Sex chromosomes were ignored.

#Results/Discussion
I would like to walk through the logic of each step with Brady and if we are going to be using this query again in the future, turn the entire script into a function that can be run easily based on genes of interest. I feel like something may be missing from the comp het logic regarding genotype of parents. And I would also like to identify other types of MIEâ€™s that I should search for. 

Overall, if the logic is correct, than not much was found. 

#Query
This query was run to find variants from ensembl in the regions of interest, add a column to identify trio member, and return results that are potential rare variants that are either not in kaviar, or in kaviar with a frequency of less than 10%:

```sql
WITH ens AS (
 SELECT DISTINCT chromosome as chr, start, stop, gene_name
   FROM public_hg19.ensembl_genes
  WHERE (gene_name IN ( 'HADH', 'HADHA', 'HADHB', 'ACAA1',
                        'ACAA2', 'EHHADH', 'ECHS1')
     OR gene_name LIKE 'HSD17B%')
    AND chromosome NOT LIKE "H%"
)
SELECT p.sample_id, p.qual, p.filter, k.id as rsID, (k.alle_freq * 100) as kav_pct, k.alle_cnt as kav_count,
gene_name, p.chr, p.pos, p.ref, p.alt, p.gt, 
 (CASE  
      WHEN SUBSTRING(p.sample_id, -2) = '01'
      THEN 'M'
      WHEN SUBSTRING(p.sample_id, -2) = '02'
      THEN 'F'
      WHEN SUBSTRING(p.sample_id, -2) = '03'
      THEN 'NB'
      END) as member, CONCAT(gene_name, ":", p.chr, ":", CAST(p.pos AS STRING)) as variant_id, 
      CONCAT(p.chr, ":", CAST(p.pos AS STRING), ":", p.alt) as alt_id 
  FROM
(SELECT DISTINCT p.sample_id, p.qual, p.filter, ens.gene_name, p.chr, p.pos, p.ref, p.alt, p.gt
   FROM ens, p7_ptb.itmi_102_puzzle p
   WHERE p.chr = ens.chr
   AND (p.pos >= ens.start AND p.pos <= ens.stop)
   AND p.gt IS NOT NULL
) AS p
LEFT JOIN /* +SHUFFLE */ public_hg19.kaviar k
       ON p.chr = k.chromosome
      AND p.pos = k.pos
      AND p.ref = k.ref
      AND p.alt = k.alt
WHERE (k.alle_freq < .10 OR k.alle_freq IS NULL)
```

## Testing results against impala
The results of the query shown above were stored as a table on impala and used to:   
- Compare counts with data subset in R  
- Examine variants at positions reported in the R analysis to verify results

###Compare genotype counts
For comparing counts, variations of the following query was used to compare resuls with R: 
```sql
SELECT COUNT(1) 
FROM ben_query as ben
WHERE ben.sample_id LIKE "%03"
AND ben.gt = "0/1"
```

```{r read_in_and_test}

dim(dad)
table(dad$gt)

nb = query[which(query$member == "NB"),]

dim(het_mom) 

#10 het moms 
het_dad = dad[which(dad$gt == "0/1"),]
dim(het_dad) 
```

Counts match impala results. 

#Search for homozygous alt alleles
The data was read into R and searched for variants in the newborn marked as homozygous for the alternate allele. If the newborn alternate allele was the same as the alternate allele for both parents at this location, or if the nb allele was a no-call but both parent alleles were equal, it was marked as a homozygous alternate.  

Homozygous alternate parent alleles were ignored.  

```{r hom_alt}

#get rid of unnecessary columns
hom_alt.df = hom_alts[,c(1:13,26:27,54:55)]
colnames(hom_alt.df) = c("variant_id", "sample_id", "qual", "filter", "rsID", "kav_freqPct", 
                      "kav_count", "gene_name", "chr", "pos","ref", "nb_alt", "nb_gt", 
                      "m_alt", "m_gt", "f_alt","f_gt")

#find variants where mother, father and newborn have matching alts at same chr/pos, or
#mom and dad alts match and nb call is null
hom_alt.df = hom_alt.df[which((hom_alt.df$nb_alt == hom_alt.df$m_alt) & (hom_alt.df$nb_alt == hom_alt.df$f_alt) | 
                                (hom_alt.df$m_alt == hom_alt.df$f_alt & hom_alt.df$nb_alt == "NULL")
                              ),]
hom_alt.df
```

##Confirm hom alt analysis
For each of the five homozygous alt newborn variants found, a query was run to manually check for all variants at that chromosome and position. 

```{r test_hom_alt}

#Mother is 0/1 and father is 1/1
hom_alt_nb[1,]

#mother and father are het
hom_alt_nb[2,]

#both parents are 1/1
hom_alt_nb[3,]

#father 0/1, mother 1/1
hom_alt_nb[4,]

#no varaint reported for mother, several variants with filter errors, low qual
hom_alt_nb[5,]

```

For each variant found that meets the criteria specified in the impala query, the results are consistent with manual examination of impala data due to the exclusion of homozygous parent variants. 

##Search for homozygous ref alleles
The data was subset for variants where the newborn marked as homozygous reference. If the newborn reference allele was the same as the reference allele in both parents het at this location, or if the nb allele was a no-call but both parent alleles were equal, it was marked as a homozygous reference.  

Homozygous reference parent allelels were ignored.  

```{r hom_ref}
#############################
#find homozygous reference ##
#############################
hom_ref_nb = nb[which(nb$gt == "0/0"),]
dim(hom_ref_nb) #6245 hom_ref variants

dim(hom_ref_nb_dad) #0/10 het dads match with homozygous ref newborns

#merge mom and dad matching variants
hom_refs = merge(hom_ref_nb_mom, hom_ref_nb_dad, by= "variant_id")

#get rid of unnecessary columns
hom_ref.df = hom_refs[,c(1:13,26:27,54:55)]
colnames(hom_ref.df) = c("variant_id", "sample_id", "qual", "filter", "rsID", "kav_freqPct",
                         "kav_count", "gene_name", "chr", "pos", "ref", "nb_alt", "nb_gt",
                         "m_alt", "m_gt", "f_alt","f_gt")

#find variants where mother, father and newborn have matching alts at same chr/pos, or
#mom and dad alts match and nb call is null
hom_ref.df = hom_ref.df[which((hom_ref.df$nb_alt == hom_ref.df$m_alt) & (hom_ref.df$nb_alt == hom_ref.df$f_alt) | 
                                (hom_ref.df$m_alt == hom_ref.df$f_alt & hom_ref.df$nb_alt == "NULL")
                              ),]
hom_ref.df
```

##Confirm hom ref analysis
For the 6245 homozygous ref newborns variants found, a random set of 5 variants will be selected and each reported position examined manually in impala. 

```{r test_hom_ref}

hom_ref_sample = hom_ref_nb[sample(1:nrow(hom_ref_nb), 5, replace=FALSE),]

#Mother and father are 0/0
hom_ref_sample[1,]

#no parent variants reported
hom_ref_sample[2,]

#no parent variants reported
hom_ref_sample[3,]

#no variant reported for father
hom_ref_sample[4,]

#no parent varaints reported 
hom_ref_sample[5,]

```

The impala results were consistent with the logic of the analysis. We may want to add in a way of handling newborn variant calls that are missing calls from either/both parents. 

##Search for compound het alleles
To locate potential compound het variants, the data was subset for het newborn variants, and the parents were subset for either heterozygous or homozygous alternate variants. The data was grouped by gene name, and a function was ran in the following order:  
- Subset variants with more than one variant position per gene  
- The mother and father variants were matched to newborn variants  

If variants were found from both parents:
- Check that the alt alleles in each parent were at different positions  
- Check that alt alleles in each parent are not in the same position  
- Return variants where the newborn has a diffent variant from mom and dad on the same gene

##Confirm Results of comp-het analysis
The results of the comp-het analysis will be confirmed by grouping the het variants found in the newborn by gene and manually examining all het variants found in the newborn on each gene. 

Variations of the following query were used to find all het newborn variants on each of the genes of interest:  
```sql

##Search for Mendelian Inheritance Errors
The resulting data set from the impala query was checked for congruence with laws of Mendelian inheritance,
as follows.  

####Het newborn variants
For newborn variants genotyped as het (0/1):  
- If the mother is 0/0, then mother must be 0/1 and the nb alt must match the fatherâ€™s alt  
- If the father is 0/0, then father must be 0/1 and the nb alt must match the motherâ€™s alt  
- If both parents are het, nb alt and parent alts must be the same  
- If the mother is 1/1, then the father must be 0/1 or 0/0 and the nb alt must match the motherâ€™s alt  
- If the father is 1/1, then the mother must be 0/1 or 0/0 and the nb alt must match the fathersâ€™s alt

##Hom alt newborn variants
For newborn variants genotyped as het (1/1):  
- If the father is 0/1, then the mother must be 1/1  
- If the mother is 0/1, then the father must be 1/1   
- Or both parents are 1/1
